				<p>I'm a student at Gymasium "Jovaj Jovanović Zmaj" in Novi Sad. I'm a web developer and I also make mobile web apps. Most apps are about helping people in every day life. You can find them on my projects page. The apps are developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I sometimes use Python for desktop apps.</p>
				<h3>My goal</h3>
				<p>My goal is to make everyday life better of people arround me. I've started developing web apps at my age of 13 and now I'm making websites and UI designs for mobile apps for Android. I use cloud services to connect devices with microcontrollers to get many kinds of data.</p>
				<p>I am also fighting for freedom and privacy in both internet and real life. You have a right to be free and to have privacy but goverments are surveillancing us. They listen to our phone calls, read texts and they even can know your current location with the help of Google, Apple and Microsoft!</p>
				<h3>Open source? Yes, of course!</h3>
				<p>All of my projects I post here will be open source. If not I will upload them to my mediafire account so you can download bynaries for mostly Windows. All my code for pc apps can be compiled for Windows, Mac, Linux or BSD.</p>
				<p>I'll post my progress about developing some apps on my twitter account. Find more about that on cantact page.</p>
				<h3>Gaming</h3>
				<p>
					I also play video games like Garry's Mod, Counter Strike: Global Offensive and make mods for some android games. Most of my free time I spend playing CS: GO but also Portal 1 and 2. Here is some of my info.</br></br>
